# TDAstraOrbbec

A Touch Designer CPP TOP adaptation of the Orbbec C++ examples for the Astra model depth camera. Created this for an interactive project; far from optimized but it meets basic needs and it can be a starting point for using other Orbbec models in Touch Designer. 

We do not plan on updating this repository, feel free to fork it and update it on your own.
